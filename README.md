# -Product-Carousel-

HTML Structure: 

I have a well-structured HTML file that includes necessary meta tags, external stylesheets, and scripts. The document includes a header, a product carousel using Bootstrap's carousel component and a custom slider section for featured products.


Styling with CSS: 

I have organized my styles using CSS. The styles define the layout, colors, and responsiveness of my page. I have used CSS variables (custom properties like --red) for easy theme adjustments.


JavaScript for Slider Functionality: 

I have used JavaScript to implement the custom slider functionality, for displaying featured products. This slider is responsive and includes dot indicators for navigation. The script dynamically creates dots based on the number of slides in the slider.


Responsiveness: 

Media queries are used to make the page responsive. The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.


Framework Used: 

Bootstrap is utilized for its Carousel component to create a visually appealing image slider at the top.

Reasoning: The use of Bootstrap provides pre-built styles, reducing the need for custom styling and enhancing the visual appeal of the page. JavaScript is used to implement specific custom functionality, such as the product slider with drag and navigation dots.
